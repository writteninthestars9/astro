      About Written in the Stars
    </h1>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      <strong>Written in the Stars</strong> is not just a digital service — it's a labor of love, intuition, and ancient wisdom. We exist to help individuals explore the spiritual bond they feel with someone special. Our <strong>handcrafted soulmate reports</strong> are based on a unique fusion of <em>Vedic</em> and <em>Western astrology</em>, offering insight into love, karma, and cosmic timing.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Every report is created manually — no bots, no auto-generated scripts — just human intuition guided by the stars. When you place an order, you’re not just filling a form — you’re opening your heart to the Universe. We honor that vulnerability by returning something deeply meaningful, written like a letter from the cosmos to your soul.

    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      Written in the Stars was founded by <strong>Sumeet Srivastava</strong>, a spiritual seeker and astrology enthusiast with over 10 years of experience in both Jyotish and Western systems. What started as a personal passion soon turned into a calling — to help others understand the inexplicable pull they feel toward someone through the lens of cosmic timing and karmic memory.

    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 30px;">
      We believe that some connections aren’t made in this lifetime — they’re remembered. If you’ve met someone and felt an inexplicable pull, a sense of déjà vu, or a love so vast it feels written in the stars... then you’re exactly where you’re meant to be.
